> The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct. Programs often need to be modified, because requirements and equipment change. Programs often need to be combined with other programs. Success at these endeavors is directly linked to the effectiveness of a programmer's expository skills.
